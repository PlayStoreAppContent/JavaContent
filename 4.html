They are also known as java buzzwords.&nbsp;<br/>1. Object-Oriented.<br/>2. Platform independent.<br/>3. Simple.<br/>4. Secured.<br/>5. Robust.<br/>6. Architecture neutral.<br/>7. Portable.<br/>8. Dynamic.<br/>9. Interpreted.<br/>10. High Performance.<br/>11. Multithreaded.<br/>12. Distributed.<br/><br/>1. Object Oriented:-<br/>Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:-<br/>i) Object<br/>ii) Class<br/>iii) Inheritance<br/>iv) Polymorphism<br/>v) Abstraction<br/>vi) Encapsulation<br/><br/>2. Platform independent:-<br/>Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="4_files/image0.gif" width="300" height="219" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />&nbsp;<br/><br/>3. Simple:-<br/>Java was designed to be easy for the professional programmer to learn and use effectively. If you already understand the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, learning Java will be even easier.<br/><br/>Best of all, if you are an experienced C++ programmer, moving to Java will require very little effort. Because Java inherits the C/C++ syntax and many of the object-oriented features of C++, most programmers have little trouble learning Java.&nbsp;<br/><br/>4. Secured:-<br/>Java is secured because:<br/>i) No explicit pointer<br/>ii) Programs run inside virtual machine sandbox.&nbsp;<br/><br/>5. Robust:-<br/>Robust simply means strong. Java uses strong memory management. There are lack of pointers that avoids security problem. There is automatic garbage collection in java. There is exception handling and type checking mechanism in java. All these points makes java robust.&nbsp;<br/><br/>6. Architectural- neutral:-<br/>There is no implementation dependent feature e.g. size of primitive types is set.&nbsp;<br/><br/>7. Portable:-<br/>We may carry the java byte code to any platform.<br/><br/>8. Dynamic:-<br/>Java programs carry with them substantial amounts of run-time type information that is used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at run time. This makes it possible to dynamically link code in a safe and expedient manner. This is crucial to the robustness of the Java environment, in which small fragments of bytecode may be dynamically updated on a running system.&nbsp;<br/><br/>9. Interpreted:-<br/>As described earlier, Java enables the creation of cross-platform programs by compiling into an intermediate representation called Java bytecode. This code can be executed on any system that implements the Java Virtual Machine. Most previous attempts at cross-platform solutions have done so at the expense of performance.&nbsp;<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C"><br/>10. High Performance:-<br/>Java is faster than traditional interpretation since byte code is &quot;close&quot; to native code still somewhat slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++)&nbsp;<br/><br/>11. Multi-threaded:-<br/>A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it shares the same memory. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications etc.&nbsp;<br/><br/>12. Distributed:-<br/>We can create distributed applications in java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. We may access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
