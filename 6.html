The code static int numGears = 6; would create such a static field. Additionally, the keyword final could be added to indicate that the number of gears will never change.<br/><br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">iii) Local Variables:-&nbsp;Similar to how an object stores its state in fields, a method will often store its temporary state in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to declaring a field (for example, int count = 0;).<br/><br/>There is no special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination comes entirely from the location in which the variable is declared </span><span class="csBC719D4E">�</span><span class="cs57154F9C"> which is between the opening and closing braces of a method.<br/><br/>As such, local variables are only visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
