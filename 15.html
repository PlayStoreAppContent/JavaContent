It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:-<br/>i) Object<br/>ii) Class<br/>iii) Inheritance<br/>iv) Interface<br/>v) Polymorphism<br/>vi) Abstraction<br/>vii) Encapsulation<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C"><br/>i) Object: -&nbsp;An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.<br/><br/>Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C"><br/>ii) Class: -&nbsp;Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.<br/><br/>In the real world, you&#39;ll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other bicycles in existence, all of the same make and model. Each bicycle was built from the same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C"><br/>iii) Inheritance: -&nbsp;Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.<br/><br/>When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C"><br/>iv) Interface: -&nbsp;The interface is a mechanism to achieve fully abstraction in java. There can be only abstract methods in the interface. It is used to achieve fully abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. Interface also represents IS-A relationship. It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C"><br/>v) Polymorphism:-&nbsp;When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convene the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.<br/><br/>In java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">vi) Abstraction: -&nbsp;Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including background details or exceptions. Abstraction refers to the ability to make a class abstract in Object oriented programming.&nbsp;<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C"><br/>vii) Encapsulation: -&nbsp;The wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit (called class) is known as Encapsulation. Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs57154F9C">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
